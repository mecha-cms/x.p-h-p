PHP Extension for [Mecha](https://github.com/mecha-cms/mecha)
=============================================================

If you don’t like the [Block](https://github.com/mecha-cms/x.block.e) evaluation method, you can use this extension to
evaluate PHP expressions in a page file. It’s just that you have to write the page content as raw HTML, so you can’t
combine this extension feature with [Markdown](https://github.com/mecha-cms/x.markdown) extension and the like (unless
you’re comfortable implementing the parser directly in your PHP code).
